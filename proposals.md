# Proposals ideas

## Idea 1: StockX Resell Items 

### High Level Description

I will be trying to predict shoe resell price from the stockx.com website. This idea came from talking with a friend that does this for a living. He buys and resells limited edition clothing items and shoes and makes an absurd profit. The arbitrary number that is decided when selling an item is pulled from this site and eyeballed. 

### Your Approach

I would use a linear regression model to try and predict the price. The EDA process here would be very interesting. I would get insight on which items sold the best and the most. 

### How will people interact with your work?

Slides would be the default for displaying my results, but the goal would to try and create a flask app that would let you pick the type of item you want to sell and get a prediction from it. If there is time I would like to have an interactive notebook. 

### What are your data sources?

There is a dataset out there that stockx has provided last year that has the price and resell price and a few other features. The down fall of this dataset is that there are only two times of shoes.


## Idea 2: StockX Resell Items 2nd Option

### High Level Description

This is the same idea as the prior, but I will create a scraper to grab a lot of more data from the Stockx site. There have been some issues with trying to scrape because they have a decent bot detector so I would have to get creative when trying get the data. 

### Your Approach

I would use a linear regression model to try and predict the price. The EDA process here would be very interesting. I would get insight on which items sold the best and the most. 

### How will people interact with your work?

Slides would be the default for displaying my results, but the goal would to try and create a flask app that would let you pick the type of item you want to sell and get a prediction from it. If there is time I would like to have an interactive notebook. 

### What are your data sources?

The data would come from the scraping of the stockx website. Doing this would give me a bunch more data that could help me better predict the resell price. 


## Idea 3: Predicting the NBA MVP

### High Level Description

I really enjoy the game of basketball. I thought it would be interesting to try create a model that would predict the MVP for 2019 or 2020. This is would be very challenging but thatâ€™s why it is my third option.

### Your Approach

### I would use a linear regression or maybe a random forest tree to try and predict the MVP.

How will people interact with your work?
Slides would be the default for displaying my results, but the goal would to try and create a flask app that would let you pick the type of item you want to sell and get a prediction from it. If there is time I would like to have an interactive notebook. 

### What are your data sources?

I would scrape basketballreference.com and get all of the winners of the MVP award and the voting data that follows. There is a bunch of interesting EDA that can be done with this, but I do believe it would be difficult to try and build this model, but with my limited time, I will try and get something working.
